\title{Annotating a plot to display differences between groups.}
\usage{
gf_star(fig, x1, y1, x2, y2, y3, legend = "*", ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{fig}{A gformula object.}

\item{x1}{Position in \code{x} for the start of the horizontal line.}

\item{y1}{Position in \code{y} for the start of the vertical line, below to the horizontal line.}

\item{x2}{Position in \code{x} for the end of the horizontal line.}

\item{y2}{Position in \code{y} where the horizontal line is drawn.}

\item{y3}{Position in \code{y} where the text is added.}

\item{legend}{Character text used for annotating the plot.}

\item{...}{Additional information passed to \code{\link[ggformula]{gf_text}}.}

\description{
\code{gf_star} Is a function used to display differences between groups (see details).
}
\details{
This function draws an horizontal line from coordinate (\code{x1}, \code{y2})
to coordinate (\code{x2}, \code{y2}). Draws vertical lines below the horizontal line,
towards data, from (\code{x1}, \code{y1}) to (\code{x1}, \code{y2}) and from
(\code{x2}, \code{y1}) to (\code{x2}, \code{y2}). Finally, adds
text above the horizontal line, at the mid point between \code{x1} and \code{x2}.
See examples.
